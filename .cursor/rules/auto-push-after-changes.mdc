# Auto Push Workflow

- When implementing user-requested code changes, run validation quickly (build/lint when relevant), then commit and push automatically.
- Do not ask for extra confirmation before push unless the user explicitly asks to review first.
- Keep commit messages concise and meaningful, following the repository style.
- If push fails, report the error and continue troubleshooting until resolved.
- If the user says not to push for a specific task, follow that request.
