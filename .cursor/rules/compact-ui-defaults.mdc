# Compact UI Defaults

- Prefer compact desktop sizing for new pages.
- Avoid oversized hero styles unless explicitly requested:
  - Avoid `text-7xl` / `text-8xl` headings by default.
  - Keep main CTA buttons around `text-lg`-`text-xl` with moderate padding.
- Keep page wrappers compact:
  - Use `max-w-6xl` (or smaller) for default page containers.
  - Prefer moderate vertical spacing (`mb-10` to `mb-16`) over very large gaps.
- For catalog grids with a single item, center the card to avoid unbalanced layouts.
- When adjusting existing pages, preserve visual style while reducing scale.
