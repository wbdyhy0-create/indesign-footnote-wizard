# Handoff First

- At the beginning of a new chat, read `docs/HANDOFF.md` before proposing changes.
- Use `docs/HANDOFF.md` as the default source of project context and current state.
- If the handoff conflicts with a new user request, follow the user's latest request and then update `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
